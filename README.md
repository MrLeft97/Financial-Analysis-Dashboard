# Financial-Analysis-Dashboard
Abstract
The purpose of our project was to leverage python to develop an analytically driven excel-based stock performance dashboard. We sought to create our dashboard by implementing the many financial libraries and techniques learned throughout this course, in addition to a highly flexible excel-based python library called Xlwings. Xlwings allows for the creation and implementation of a seamless communication channel between python and excel. The library can be adapted to create unique user defined functions in excel, which can be used to automate data analysis through the use of python scripts. The application allows users to input two key variables, stock tickers and date ranges. The application will then automatically calculate fundamental facets of financial analysis. Our application focuses on key concepts associated with both descriptive and predictive analytics. An overview of the key methods involved in the application can be found in the following section.
